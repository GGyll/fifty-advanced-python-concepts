# 50 Advanced Python Concepts for Senior Interviews

This repository contains code samples and explanations for 50 advanced Python concepts that are commonly tested in senior Python developer interviews. These concepts focus on memory management, performance optimization, and writing clean, maintainable code‚Äîkey skills that separate senior engineers from mid-level developers.

## Watch the Video
I walk through these concepts in my YouTube video:

## Why This List?
I've done over 25 interviews for senior Python developer positions, some with compensation up to $200k. During these interviews, I noticed that most Python prep materials cover only the basics‚Äîleaving candidates unprepared for the deeper technical questions that truly matter at the senior level.

This repository is a result of my experience. Learning these concepts (especially asyncio and concurrency/paralellism) has personally helped me land job offers paying up to $10k/month.

## What You'll Find Here
- Code examples illustrating each concept
- Explanations of why these concepts matter in real-world applications
- A study guide to help you prepare for senior Python interviews
